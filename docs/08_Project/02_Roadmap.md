# Roadmap

RedBeanPHP is actively developed by a community of open source
developers. The development cyclus of RedBeanPHP consists of two releases
a year; a spring release and an autumn release. This means every six
months there will be a new version of RedBeanPHP.

*   Spring Beta release: **March**
*   Spring Final release: **April**
*   Autumn Beta release: **September**
*   Autumn Final release: **October**

For actual information about the upcoming (beta) release visit the
[beta
testing pages](/beta_testing "Help us test the latest beta release!").

## Upcoming versions

RedBeanPHP is quite mature and stable. All features necessary have been implemented and even
more features are implemented using the plugin architecture - however we don't want RedBeanPHP
to become bloated. For the next version of RedBeanPHP we are considering features like
improved support of Composer and namespaces. Feel free to discuss feature requests on our
[forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/redbeanorm "Discuss the future of RedBeanPHP!").

For details concerning **versioning** guidelines of RedBeanPHP take a look at the
[versioning page](/versioning "Learn more about RedBeanPHP versioning").
