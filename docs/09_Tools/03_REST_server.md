# REST server

In RedBeanPHP 3.5 you can use the new Resty BeanCan Server. The Resty BeanCan server
makes it easy to make a REST-like API.
To create a Resty BeanCan Server:

```php
$can = new RedBean_Plugin_BeanCanResty;
```

## Whitelist

The first thing to do is to tell RedBeanPHP what methods are allowed per type.
To allow users to perform GET and POST but not PUT and DELETE actions for books use:

```php
$can->setWhitelist(array(
	'book' => array(
		'GET', 'POST'
	)
));
```

For testing purposes, you might want to allow everything:

```php
$can->setWhitelist('all');
```

## GET request

The Resty BeanCan Server works with a reference bean. For instance a $user.
To access or modify a resource you simply pass the path relative to the user and you pass the
(HTTP) method:

```php
$can->handleREST($user, 'book/2', 'GET');
//returns array('result' => array( $property => $value ) )
```

This will retrieve the own list of the $user and load the book with ID 2. Note that this method will
fail if no such book exists in the list. By default, the Resty Can searches in the own list, to search
in the shared list, prefix your list with 'shared-':

```php
$can->handleREST($user, 'site/3/page/4/shared-ad/2', 'GET');
```

This will retrieve ad 2 on page 4 of site 3.

## PUT request

To add a new page:

```php
$can->handleREST($user, 'site/3/page', 'PUT', array(
	'bean' => array(
		'title' => 'my new page'
	)
)); //returns array('result'=>array('id' => 1))
```

## POST request

To update page 4:

```php
$can->handleREST($user, 'site/3/page/4', 'POST', array(
	'bean' => array(
		'title' => 'changed title'
	)
));
```

## DELETE request

To delete page 4:

```php
$can->handleREST($user, 'site/3/page/4', 'DELETE');
```

## GET request for lists

<p>
To get a list of pages:

```php
$can->setWhitelist(array('page'=>'GET')); //you need access to PAGE!
$can->handleREST($user, 'site/3/page/list', 'GET');
```

You can predefine SQL snippets:

```php
$can->setWhitelist(array('page'=>'GET')); //you need access to PAGE!

$sql = array('page'=>array(
	' page.number > ? ', array(3)
));

//for shared pages use 'shared-page' as key!

$can->handleREST($user, 'site/3/page/list', 'GET', array(), $sql);
```

## Custom requests

The BeanCan server also accepts non-rest methods, these will invoke methods on
models connected to beans (FUSE):

```php
$resp = $can->handleREST($user,
	'site/'.$site->id.'/page/'.$page->id,
	'mail', array('param'=>array('me')));

//calls $page->mail('me');
```

## Return values

The handleRest() method returns
an array with an error key or a result key. This allows you to do
your own post-processing, i.e. convert to JSON or XML.
If an error occurs, you get an array like this:

```php
array(
	'error'=> message,
	'code' => code
)
```

If you want to return beans in a custom REST method, use
[R::beansToArray()](/import_and_export#toarray "Returning beans as an array in REST server.").

## Error Codes

The error codes in the response array conform to HTTP error codes:
exceptions generate a 500 code, if the bean is not on the whitelist
you get a 403 code, if the bean cannot be found you get a 404 code other
errors (syntax) return a 400 code.

Don't forget to configure the [whitelist](/beancan_server#whitelist "Learn about the whitelist for all BeanCan Servers.")!

## Legacy REST Server (only get)

This server is now deprecated.
In RedBeanPHP 3.0 the BeanCan server also responds to RESTFul GET requests. To setup a REST server
with beancan:

```php
$server = new RedBean_BeanCan();
$server->handleRESTGetRequest('/book/2'); //returns book with ID 2
$server->handleRESTGetRequest('/book'); //returns books
");

?>
